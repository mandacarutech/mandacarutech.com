              Right from the start Mandacaru has been working under the staff
              augmentation paradigm. Understanding the needs of each particular
              business is the first step towards project execution success. The
              familiarization of the businessâ€™ day to day practices are integral
              to the steps of our software development lifecycle. Our team
              thinks and acts about projects as if they were one with your
              company. This allows for a painless process of ramping up and
              ramping down and one more aligned with the demand.
